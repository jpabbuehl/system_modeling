Gene expression profiles (GEP) data are generated by Califano lab at Columbia University. Profiling is done on Affymetrix Human Genome U219 96-array plate. All samples were normalized with RMA normalization method using Bioconductor package in R.

This is a tab-delimited text file that contains probe set level expression of LY3 cell line treated with 14 drugs, DMSO and baseline expression.  Each column represents data from one condition and each row represents gene expression (in log2 space) for a single probe set. 
There are 4 header rows in the expression file. 
First header row: Name of the sample
Second header row: Name of 14 drugs and DMSO. It also contains Media sample that refers to the baseline expression of LY3 cell line. 
Third header row:  Time in hrs, at which the samples were profiled after treatment. 
Fourth header row: Concentration of drug treatment. For drugs it’s either IC20 or 1/10th of IC20. For media sample it is always N/A. 

All conditions for drug treatment are in triplicate. For DMSO, each condition is repeated 8 times and for media, each sample is in duplicate. 

ACalifano_DLBCL_Lyc_14Comp_titration_curves.xlsx: File containg titration curves for all drugs. It also reports IC20 concenration for all drugs. If for some drug IC20 could not be determined from  titation curve then 10uM concentraion is used as default. 

SNP profiling is done on Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0
